			<li>
				<p>Reduce heat under skillet to medium. Do not drain skillet.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Once onion has caramelized, add minced garlic to skillet. Stir to incorporate, then let onions and garlic cook together 2 minutes or until garlic has softened."/p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>After 2 minutes, add garam masala, cumin, paprika, turmeric, ground mustard, cayenne, ground ginger, and cinnamon to skillet. Stir to fully incorporate all spices. Continue stirring, cooking 1 minute or until spices are fragrant.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Add tomato paste to skillet. Stir just until paste and spices are fully incorporated.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pour in apple cider vinegar to deglaze skillet. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits that might be stuck to bottom of skillet.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pour in beef stock and gently stir to incorporate. Return browned beef to skillet and let mixture cook over medium heat until liquid begins to boil.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When liquid just begins to boil, reduce heat to medium-low. Cover skillet with lid and let beef and sauce simmer 60 minutes. While simmering, stir mixture occasionally and flip beef as needed to ensure even cooking. <span class="prep">Note: if sauce becomes too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons beef stock as needed to thin sauce back out. Stir to fully incorporate stock before adding more.</span></p>

			<li>
				<p>When beef is fully cooked and tender, and sauce has thickened to desired consistency, taste sauce and adjust salt as needed. <span class="prep">Note: if vinegar flavor is too strong, stir in ½ to 1 packed teaspoon brown sugar and simmer another 2 to 3 minutes.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When satisfied with flavor of sauce, remove skillet from heat. Divide beef vindaloo into equal portions and serve immediately over basmati rice with warmed naan and 1 to 2 dollops plain Greek yogurt if desired.</p>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Beef Chuck:</h3> Lamb, pork, and chicken will all work in this dish. Chicken will need a shorter cook time.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Cayenne:</h3> For a more mild vindaloo, omit the cayenne entirely.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Vinegar:</h3> White vinegar can be used in place of apple cider vinegar. If the vinegar flavor is too strong after simmering the sauce for 60 minutes, stir in ½-1 packed teaspoon brown sugar and let mixture simmer another 2-3 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Greek Yogurt:</h3> If you’re sensitive to heat, definitely serve your vindaloo with 1-2 dollops of Greek yogurt. It’ll help offset some of the spiciness of the dish.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Basmati Rice:</h3> Check out our recipe for <a href="https://easyhealthyrecipes.com/instant-pot-basmati-rice/" target="_blank">Instant Pot Basmati Rice</a>! It works perfectly for this vindaloo recipe.
